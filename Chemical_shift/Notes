1. catdcd -o HypaCas_R1-4_stride10000.trr -otype trr -stride 10 HypaCas_R1-4_stride1000_prot.dcd [in /mnt/mainpool] ## for prot only traj 40 frames per rep

2. run job.sh [break the trajs to individual frame pdbs and then edit the pdbs to replace HIE with HIS.. necessary for shiftX2 to run]

3. python shiftx2.py -b "/scratch/SOUVIK/Lisi_NMR_Mutants/Hypa_0MM/frames_for_CS/frame*.pdb" -a BACKBONE  ## getting CS for backbone
## for running shiftX2.py, python2 is needed.. so i'm running in conda environment py2.7
   

#### ----- Notes on shiftx2 installation: ----- ##########

1. SHIFTX2 includes a version of legacy BLAST (version 2.2.22) which should run under
Linux with i386 CPU. If your system architecture is different from i386 or your OS
is not Linux, you need to download the suitable version of *legacy* BLAST from:

ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/release/2.2.22/

and replace the folder shiftx2/shifty2/blast with the unzipped files. Make sure the
name of the BLAST folder is shiftx2/shifty2/blast and all BLAST executable should be
located in shiftx2/shifty2/blast/bin/


WARNING: BLAST website doesn't have legacy databases anymore. So look into "https://anaconda.org/biocore/blast-legacy/files"



2. with error: sh: /tmp/1665455194/1665455198/xalign_x: /lib/ld-linux.so.2: bad ELF interpreter: No such file or directory

The cause of the “bad ELF interpreter” error is usually because the operating system doesn’t have the support libraries to run 32-bit applications, so we need to install them


sudo yum provides ld-linux.so.2 ## get the package name
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install dnf
sudo dnf install glibc.i686 ## install package


3. replace HIE with HIS in pdb file

##### ----------------------------------------------- ##############

4. for all the pdbs we will get frame*.pdb.cs where the chemical shift values are printed. Now to process those files to obtain average chemical shift for each atom and associated stdeviation, run "calc_avg_CS.sh". This scipt will ask for 2 atoms; 1. H (default) and 2. other backbone atoms like N/C/CA/CB. And it will out put 3 files containing the average and stdev values 1. one file for the chemical shift perturbation correspond to both the given input atoms 2. one file for H atom 3. one file for the 2nd atom
